### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This note was written in Markdown. If you know what that is you can skip ahead to shortcuts (they are really useful, trust me! ðŸ˜Š).

To show you what hypermark can do, just type `*hello*`on the line below and press Enter:

You should see that the "hello" is italicised like this: *hello*. 

Boom! We can format text using only keyboard characters and hypermark automatically knows how to properly translate it. Type `**hello**`, `# Big Heading` and `### Small Heading` I think you can see where this is going ðŸ˜‰

This is just scratching the surface. With markdown you can make lists, blockquotes, or code blocks and much more easily. If you want to learn more about the format go to [https://commonmark.org/help/](https://commonmark.org/help/)

PS. If you wonder how I made text `look like this` just surround any text with backticks (the "\`" character)
